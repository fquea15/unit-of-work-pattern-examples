# Unit of Work Pattern - Implementations in C#, Java, and Python

## üìå What is the Unit of Work Pattern?

The **Unit of Work** design pattern aims to coordinate the writing of changes to multiple business objects by grouping them into a single transaction. This ensures data consistency and simplifies the management of complex operations.

## ‚úÖ Key Principles

- **Atomicity**: All operations are executed as a single unit.
- **Centralized transaction management**.
- **Reduction of database calls**: Commit is performed only once.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Advantages

- Ensures data coherence and consistency.
- Facilitates unit testing and separation of concerns.
- Improves performance by reducing unnecessary database access.

## ‚ùå Disadvantages

- Adds complexity to small projects.
- Requires a learning curve to fully understand its implementation.

## üåê Implementations by Language

### 1. C# with Entity Framework

```csharp
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable {
    IUserRepository Users { get; }
    int Complete();
}
```

See: [`unit_of_work_csharp.cs`](./unit_of_work_csharp.cs)

### 2. Java with Hibernate

```java
public class UnitOfWork implements AutoCloseable {
    private Session session;
    private Transaction transaction;
    ...
}
```

See: [`unit_of_work_java.java`](./unit_of_work_java.java)

### 3. Python with SQLAlchemy

```python
@contextmanager
def unit_of_work(Session):
    session = Session()
    ...
```

See: [`unit_of_work_python.py`](./unit_of_work_python.py)
